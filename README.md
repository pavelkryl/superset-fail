# superset-fail

This is driving me crazy. I have tried to install superset many times over over again - because I could not sign in with `admin`, `admin` even after launching command to change admin's password. Then I gave up with version 4.1.1 and tried to use 3.1.3 - and voila it works! Spent 4 hours with this today.

Must be something wrong in version 4.1.1 - attaching layout/directory structure where you can easily replicate. Once you verify that it does NOT work (with image version 4.1.1), cleanup the persistent directories, change the image version to 3.1.3 and boot again.
